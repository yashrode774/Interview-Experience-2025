- Inheritance in very detail, how it will work for the access modifiers and thorws Exception.
- HashMap internal working, can we modify the hash function?
- Simple SQL
- Behavioural round (Went well for me but no offer)

- [ ] What is difference between save and persist
- [ ] atomic integer
- [ ] What is AOP: (AOP is seperation of logging, security, caching, transaction management from the main business Logic, in SB we use @Aspect, @Before, @After, @Around, @AfterReturning, @AfterThrowing for that)

- [x] Purpose of private method inside method interface
- [x] Can interface have private method- Yes from java 9 we can have a private method, it is introduced to create a helper method for other default and static methods, in java.
- [x] String constant pool, where objects and literals are stored.
- [x] Can we achieve Encapsulation without abstraction - Yes, by creating a private variable and public method to access it.

Xoriant
- Failed because of Immutable class(instead of private final data member I said final static)
- asked a SQL query
- asked multithreading, serialization, example of deadlock, how it actually happens
- asked a easy coding question and then asked to implement it using streams
- asked basic OOP things, has-a and is-a relationship

- Got an offer
- Overall process of an spring boot app what all layers it goes through
- what is IOC and @Autowired
- What is cursor

- Project life cycle things

Citi: (karat: External company who took the first screening interview) -- Theory part was very hard to be honest
- how to do something before returing a response from a controller
- how to do something after
- how to implement paginatin and sorting
- A rest api call takes so much time, how do we make this process fast
- coding question (medium) array of string and find a target palindromic string in the array.
- a 2-d array of characters find a word in it example “apple” you can go right and down
