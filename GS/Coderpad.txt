GS: Was asked a simple graph question, I couldn't do the representation properly so failed in the coderpad itself.


Graph topics to be done: 
Single source shortest path - bfs ✅

Connected Components in an Undirected Graph ✅
Number of Islands (Leetcode 200) ✅

LCA — IMPPPPPPPPP

Cycle
Detect Cycle in Undirected Graph (using DFS or Union-Find) ✅
Detect Cycle in Directed Graph (DFS + recursion stack)✅ — use of pathVis

Topological Sort using Kahn’s Algorithm (BFS) ✅
Course Schedule ✅	
Course Schedule II ✅

Dijkstra’s Algorithm (with priority queue)

- If time permits
Grid as Graph (common in interviews)
* Number of Islands (Leetcode 200) ✅
* Rotting Oranges (Leetcode 994) ✅
* Surrounded Regions (Leetcode 130)✅
* Walls and Gates (Leetcode 286)✅
Union Find (Disjoint Set Union - DSU)
	Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) using kruskal’s


For a directed graph, to detect cycle, we need to maintain a pathVis array which will indicate if the child has came in the current pathVis if yes, then there is a cycle.
